<h2>
Step1)
Fold a rectangular sheet of paper in half from top to bottom. Fold in half again, and a third time.
<br>
Step2)
Fold the paper from left to right, then unfold, smoothing with your hand.
<br>
Step3)
Next, fold the left side down at 90 degrees, about 3cm from the central fold. Repeat on the right side.
<br>
Step4)
Fold the right side over the left to make the handle of the gun.
<br>
Step5)
To make the barrel, fold a second piece of paper in half 3 times as before, then fold from left to right but do not unfold.
<br>
Step6)
Carefully slide the barrel into the handle. This means you can load small soft balls of paper for sling shotting at targets.
