<h2>
Step1)Fold and unfold the square along the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner of the square.
<br>
Step2)Turn the paper over.
<br>
Step3)Fold and unfold the square in half so that the top meets the bottom edge of the paper.
<br>
Step4)Fold the top left corner down to the crease you made in the previous so that the corner meets the crease and the bottom left corner becomes a sharp point.
<br>
Step5)Take the far right edge of the flap and fold it so that it lines up with the left edge of the paper.
<br>
Step6)Fold the right side over to line up with the left edge.
<br>
Step7)Fold the left edge of the flap you just created to line up with the lower right edge, making the paper symmetric.
<br>
Step8)Completely unfold the flap on the right and the top part of the flap on the left.
<br>
Step9)Crease along the marked orange line to form a triangle that you will fold down so that the tip of the triangle is pointed towards the bottom right.
<br>
Step10)Flatten the point of the flap down to the right/bottom.
<br>
Step11)Unfold the flap you just created so that it forms a triangle.
<br>
Step12)Continue the crease you last created to make a new flap with a pointed corner at the top right of the paper.
<br>
Step13)the right edge of the flap to line up with the left edge of the paper.
<br>
Step14)ld the right edge of the paper to line up with the left edge of the paper.
<br>
Step15)Fold the left edge of the flap you just created to line up with the right edge. The paper should look symmetric.
<br>
Step16)Unfold everything.
Step17.Turn the paper so that the bottom left corner points towards you.
<br>
Step18.Create a fold along the dotted line pointing left, pinching and flattening it on top of the upper fold.
<br>
Step19.Flip the paper and create folds along the dotted lines by pinching the small flaps created in the previous  .
<br>
Step20.Push inward flatten the new flaps upward as shown.
<br>
Step21.Flatten the flaps towards the bottom of the paper. These will become the legs.
<br>
Step22.Fold those flaps down at a slight angle so that a triangle is created between them. (See picture for reference)
<br>
Step23.Fold and unfold the top corners of the middle flaps down to create sharp points. The inner points of these new flaps meet crease lines that are already there.
<br>
Step24)With both flaps completely unfolded, open the edge of leg and fold the paper in along the creases you created in the previous  .
<br>
Step25.Fold the bottom point of the paper to meet the middle corners of the flaps in the middle of the paper, unfold.
<br>
Step27.Fold the top point of the paper down to meet the crease created in   26.
<br>
Step28.Fold the point that meets the crease created in   27 (this is the same point used in the previous  ) up so it meets the top of the paper.
<br>
Step29.Unfold.
<br>
Step30.Fold the paper in half vertically, to the rear, so that the middle flaps remain on the outside of the fold.
<br>
31.Hold the paper with the middle flaps pointing towards the left.
<br>
32.Push the top edge of the paper down so that a curve is created. Then pinch the outside edges of the paper so that there is a triangle pointing towards the left. This will become the head.
<br>
33.Unfold the top and bottoms fold of the paper where the head will be, so that there is only one layer.
<br>
3Step1)Crease the paper along the pink dotted lines so that a valley is created. Be sure to crease the edges of the outer two segments of the head. Pinch the inner valley that you created and push the outer two segments of the head down to create a shape similar to a kite
<br>
35.Opening the center fold of the paper, fold the head down along the pink dotted line and then fold the paper back up a little higher up the neck towards the head.
<br>
36.Push up the corners of the upper section in and flatten them, making small triangles as shown in the picture.
<br>
37.Holding the neck, fold the tip of the nose about halfway and push it inside of the head flap. Pinch to flatten. The head is complete.
<br>
38.Turn the paper so that the head and legs of the dinosaur point down towards you.
<br>
39.Unfold the flap made in   25 on the side of the paper that is facing you
<br>
40,Fold the bottom points of the legs upwards into a small triangle.
<br>
41.Fold the bottom edge of the triangles forward. These will be the feet.
<br>
42.Remake the crease unfolded in   39.
<br>
43.Repeat   42 on the other leg.
<br>
4Step1)Open the paper so that the legs/feet are facing upward towards you.
<br>
45.Fold a joint into the tail by folding the bottom point of the paper down about three-fourths of the way from the tail, and then folding it up a little further down the tail. This   is similar to the joint made in the neck in   35.
<br>
46.Repeat the previous   further down on the tail. (the third photo is from the inside of the dinosaur)
<br>
47.Fold the dinosaur in half, as in   30.
